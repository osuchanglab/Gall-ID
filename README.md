Gall-ID
===============

This site provides all code and applications necessary for creating a website for species identification or genotyping. A working implementation of **Microbe-ID** for plant pathogens in the genus *Phytophthora* can be found at [Phytophthora-ID](http://phytophthora-id.org). This site allows identification of species based on ITS or *cox*-spacer sequences as well as placement of SSR genotypes into known reference populations.  

Components
------

To install Microbe-ID on your server you need the following components and applications:
- Your own linux server
- A website based on [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to host your version of Microbe-ID
- A self-hosted [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) R server session running on your server
- Two [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) R scripts for server and user interface (UI)
- Your custom fasta database for **Sequence-ID**
- Your custom tab-delimited text file for **Genotype-ID** compatible with the [*poppr*](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/poppr-r-package-population-genetics) R package

This site was built solely with open source components.

Designed and built by members of the [Grunwald lab](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu). For questions, please contact [Javier Tabima](caifaz01@gmail.com).
